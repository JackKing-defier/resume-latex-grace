\datedsubsection{\textbf{Product Delivery Platform}}{Oct. 2022-- now}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I upgraded channels, developed the PC version, implemented conditional filtering, and optimized campaign interfaces. This resulted in a reduction of the system's average response time from 650ms to 480ms, and we achieved over 2 million daily active users (DAU).
  \item Finished data mining components(Feature-Indexing/Feature-Merging/Feature-Normalization/Scoring).
\end{itemize}


\datedsubsection{\textbf{China Telecom Big Data Application Contest (\nth{1}/1112; Team Leader)}}{Dec. 2015 -- Mar. 2016}
The goal of this contest is to predict views of users with ten sites succeeding, according to four hundred million user-behavior historical records(25.38G).
\begin{itemize}
  \item Proposed and implemented a multi-target regression algorithm on Spark. Optimized F1-score 0.8\%.
  \item Designed and developed a probability ranking model for user classification. Optimized F1-score  0.6\%.
\end{itemize}
